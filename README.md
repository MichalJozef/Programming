Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michal JOZEF.
I am 40-year-old hobby programmer aspiring for "real" profesional entry level job.
Up until now I was working as application specialist in Tatra banka and Raiffeisen Informatik.

You can find here a bundle of different projects varing both in programming language as well as in level of difficulty and complexity.
All in all it is a representation of rather basic and simple projects, so do not expect anything beyond that scope.

Nevertheless, I am looking forward get an opportunity to prove, than I am truly passionate and capable to step further on my way profesional programming.
