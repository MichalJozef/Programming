Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michal JOZEF. I am a 40-year-old hobby programmer aspiring to a "real" professional entry level job. Up until now I have worked as an application specialist in Tatra banka and Raiffeisen Informatik.

You can find here a bundle of different projects varying both in the programming language as well as in the level of difficulty and complexity. All in all, it is a representation of rather basic and simple projects, so do not expect anything beyond that scope.

Nevertheless, I am looking forward to getting an opportunity to prove that I am truly passionate, capable, and ready to make a step further on my path to professional programming.
